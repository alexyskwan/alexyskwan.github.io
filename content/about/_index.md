# About Me

I'm not actually from the mountains; it's part of my Chinese name: yeung-saan -- looking up at the mountain.

I was born and raised in Hong Kong and moved with my family to San Francisco Bay Area when I was 10. Eventually I went to UC Davis for my "higher" education and got a completely useless BA in English. I'm now meandering around Hong Kong, doing gods know what. Kidding, I do have a job writing for the kids' edition of a local English newspaper.

And yes, that is my cat.
